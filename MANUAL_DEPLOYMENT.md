# 🚀 Manual Deployment Instructions

## ✅ GitHub Secrets Verified!

Your GitHub secrets are properly configured. Since GitHub's push protection is preventing us from pushing due to credentials in git history, here's how to deploy manually:

4. **Click "Run workflow"**
5. **Select branch**: `deploy-templated-responses` (or `main` if you merge)
6. **Click "Run workflow"**

### Option 2: Merge to Main Branch
1. **Create a Pull Request** from `deploy-templated-responses` to `main`
2. **Merge the PR** (this will trigger the workflow)
3. **Monitor deployment** in GitHub Actions
