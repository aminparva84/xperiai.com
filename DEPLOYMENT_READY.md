## 🔐 Required GitHub Secrets

You need to add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

### Steps to Add Secrets:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Add these two secrets:

| Secret Name | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | `[Your AWS Access Key ID]` |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | `[Your AWS Secret Access Key]` |

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment
1. **Add the GitHub secrets** (above)
2. **Push to main branch**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy with templated responses"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **Monitor deployment** in GitHub Actions tab

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select **Deploy Xperi AI to AWS App Runner**
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Select branch and click **Run workflow**

## 📊 What Happens During Deployment

1. **Build Phase**:
   - GitHub Actions checks out your code
   - Builds Docker image with your application
   - Includes the new templated response system

2. **Push Phase**:
   - Pushes image to ECR repository (`xperiai-app`)
   - Tags with commit SHA and `latest`

3. **Deploy Phase**:
   - App Runner detects new image
   - Automatically deploys the updated application
   - Service becomes available at your App Runner URL

4. **Verify Phase**:
   - Checks deployment status
   - Provides service URL
   - Confirms successful deployment

## 🌐 Your Application URLs

Once deployed, your application will be available at:
- **Main App**: `https://qaptibvncn.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com`
- **Chat Interface**: `https://qaptibvncn.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/chat`
- **Admin Dashboard**: `https://qaptibvncn.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/admin`

## 🎯 Expected Results

After successful deployment:
- ✅ **Templated Responses**: Every agent response will have beautiful, branded styling
- ✅ **Constitution Agent**: 🏛️ Green-themed template with legal expertise branding
- ✅ **General Agent**: 🤖 Blue-themed template with Xperi AI branding
- ✅ **Professional Look**: Gradients, shadows, timestamps, and company branding
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on all devices

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails:
1. **Check GitHub Actions logs** for specific errors
2. **Verify AWS credentials** in GitHub secrets
3. **Check ECR repository** exists (workflow creates it automatically)
4. **Verify App Runner service** is running

### Common Issues:
- **Permission denied**: Check AWS credentials
- **ECR repository not found**: Workflow creates it automatically
- **Build failures**: Check Dockerfile and requirements.txt
- **Service not updating**: Check App Runner auto-deploy settings

## 📱 Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test these features:
1. **Visit your App Runner URL**
2. **Go to the chat interface**
3. **Ask a constitutional question** (should get 🏛️ templated response)
4. **Ask a general question** (should get 🤖 templated response)
5. **Check admin dashboard** for contact submissions

## 🎉 Success!

Your automated deployment pipeline is now ready! Every time you push code to the main branch, GitHub Actions will:
- Build your application with the latest changes
- Deploy it to AWS App Runner
- Make it available with beautiful templated responses

**Next step**: Add the GitHub secrets and push your code to trigger the first automated deployment!
